"You aren't fit to govern, let alone live!"
"Come you tedious fool, to the purpose!"
"Is that chain mail? Or are you wearing a dress?!"
"C'mere you! I like you!"
"Over here, squire! I need help with my codpiece!"
"I'll split you open like a ripe melon!"
"Each one of you is worse than the other!"
"You're like a wench, whose natural gifts were poor!"
"Ah, one who has matched my skill."
"Finally a fair fight."
"You are more than meets the eye."
"You nearly had me."
"You fought well, but for the wrong side."
"You are stronger than I thought."
"I met my match."
