"It's a fine peasant rebellion you have here."
"You call that a Coat of Arms?"
"After I've run you through, next is your mother."
"You smell like a woman!"
"It looks like the peasants rose up, and found swords."
"Oh, I've had sheep that put up more fight than you."
"Your sword looks a little short, if you know what I mean."
"Show me your backside, 'tis your best side!"
"What a fight."
"Ah, finally met my match."
"I've heard of you."
"Grand so, good fight."
"I've never seen such skill in battle."
"You did your family honor, die with dignity."
"A worthy aversary."
"Unbelievable resistance, incredible."
"Never have I been matched so."
"Finally a fight to match my own."
"I've never seen such skill in battle, may I never see it again."
