"The battle's this way, gorgeous!"
"Oh my, aren't you handsome? Better not turn my back on you."
"If you're trying to kill me, you're going the wrong way!"
"Maybe if you throw enough of them, one of them will actually hit me."
"You sure got a lot of armor on!"
"That's a pretty big sword! Are you compensating for something?"
"Don't look at me like that... it's creepy!"
"You fight well, I shall name a daughter after you!"
"Come here and fight me like a man!"
"Finally, a fair fight."
"You fought well, it'd be a shame to kill you."
"You fought well, I shall name my first born in your memory, ha-ha!"
"You're a skilled fighter, but you're on the wrong side."
"Finally a worthy opponent."
"Ah, I see you're no stranger to the blade."
"You fight well, it's a shame you choose the wrong side."
"This has been fun, it's time to end it."
